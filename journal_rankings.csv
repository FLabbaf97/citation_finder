32586,The sensitivity of a malignant cell line to hyperthermia (42 degrees C) at low intracellular pH.,"The postulate that low intracellular pH acts as a preconditioner for the destructuve effects of hyperthermia (42 degrees C) was examined, using  a heat-sensitive line of malignant cells derived from rat mammary gland (SDB). Intracellular pH (pHi) was measured indirectly, from the distribution of the weak, non-metabolizable organic acid 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione (DMO) between intra- and extra-cellular water. Respiration, aerobic and anaerobic and anaerobic glycolysis of the cells were studied at normal pHi (pH 7-0-7-4) or at low pHi (pH 6-2-6-6) and at 38 degrees C or 42 degrees C over 6 h in Warburg manometers; the ability of the cells to replicate in culture was examined after 3 h or 6 h incubation in the flasks. The relationship between pHi and extracellular pH (pHe) depended upon the buffer system used and the exact pH in question; no assumption regarding pHi based only on pHe measurement could be made. At 38 degrees C and low pHi, the Pasteur effect became negative due to a relatively greater inhibition of anaerobic than aerobic glycolysis. Respiration was unaffected and cell replicative ability unimpaired. At 42 degrees C and normal pHi, respiration was totally inhibited after 4 h and the Pasteur effect was decreased, in this case due to a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis without alteration in anaerobic CO2 production. Low pHi in the presence of hyperthermia enabled cell respiration to continue at a reduced level with no further change in glycolysis. There was delayed cell replication after 3 h at 42 degrees C and inability to multiply following 6 h hyperthermia: low pHi did not influence these results. It is concluded that with these cancer cells, pHi values maintained in the region of 1-0 pH unit below normal for 6 h had no deleterious effect on the cells. No sensitizing effect of the low pHi for the destructive effect of hyperthermia on the cells was observed.",British journal of cancer,2025171,9969,1976,CC BY,4.0,4.0
33725,Anti-leukaemia activity as a bystander effect of graft-versus-host reactions.,"The production of graft-versus-host (GVH) reactions in (PVGc X Wistar) F1 hybrids by the transfer of PVGc spleen cells resulted in significant resistance of these recipients to a subsequent challenge with the PVGc leukaemia. Protection was markedly dependent on dose and timing of allogeneic cell transfer and was abrogated by irradiation of the cells prior to transfer. GVH activity was shown to be a prerequisite for induction of the protective effect but was equally effective when produced by the transfer of Wistar spleen cells in place of PVGc cells. These points, plus the fact that invitro investigations of possible immune mechanisms failed to demonstrate cytotoxic immunity in treated rats, suggested a nonspecific ""bystander"" effect as the mechanism of protection. The implications of such a mechanism are discussed.",British journal of cancer,2025092,5100,1976,CC BY,4.0,4.0
33726,The effect of aflatoxins on the incorporation of RNA and protein precursors by isolated hepatocytes.,"Hepatocytes prepared by a simplified enzymatic technique were active in the incorporation of RNA and protein precursors into acid-insoluble material. The incorporation of RNA precursors was very markedly inhibited by low levels of aflatoxin B1 and G1 but not by aflatoxins B2 and G2. The activity of mixed function oxidases (MFO), the drug-metabolizing system of the endoplasmic reticulum, could be suppressed in these cells by SKF525A or stimulated by NADPH. SKF525A caused a reduction in the inhibition by aflatoxin B1 of the incorporation of RNA precursor into macromolecules. This finding suggests that a metabolite of aflatoxin B1 is the actual inhibitor of RNA synthesis in the cells. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity showed these cells to be leaky on incubation at 37 degrees C and thus not suitable for studies of protein secretion.",British journal of cancer,2025075,5101,1976,CC BY,4.0,4.0
46924,Chemical injuries of the upper extremity.,"The prompt recognition and management (Tables 8-1 and 8-2) of chemical burns of the upper extremity may prevent injury to the deep structures of the hand and may make the difference between satisfactory rehabilitation and crippling deformities. Immediate irrigation with water is the single most important treatment that can be carried out, and should be continued for at least an hour and often for several hours, depending on the severity of the injury. Precious time should not be wasted hunting for a specific neutralizing agent. Hydrofluoric acid injuries and phosphorus injuries are the two exceptions to this principle. After copious irrigation and d√©bridement, small superficial burns may be treated without dressings or topical therapy. Large partial-thickness burns are best treated with Sulfamylon burn cream and then with with biologic dressings until healing is achieved. Full-thickness injuries of limited extent should be excised and skin-grafted to regain maximum function, and more extensive burns treated in a nonexicisional regimen.",Major problems in clinical surgery,10132827,3697,1976,CC BY,,

56022,Circulating levels of prolactin in human breast cancer.,"Serum prolactin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassays in 98 patients with established carcinoma of breast, 12 patients with cystic mastitis and 10 patients with gynaecomastia and compared with that of age matched normal control women. The serum prolactin levels in the patients with breast cancer, gynaecomastia or cystic mastitis were observed to be similar to that in normal women. It was interesting to note that the levels of prolactin in the luteal phase of the cycle were higher than that in the early follicular phase in normal women.",British journal of cancer,2024836,2274,1975,CC BY,4.0,4.0
57486,[Experience with the management of subtalar dislocation].,"In 10 and 3 years resp., material of two surgical departments - with great material - 10 cases of luxation - without fracture - occurred in the subtaler joint have been treated. All 10 patients suffered covered, subtaler dislocations. After conservative treatment all 10 patients recovered and are back at work.","Magyar traumatologia, orthopaedia es helyreallito sebeszet",10037170,3689,1976,CC BY,,
